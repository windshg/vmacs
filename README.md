vmacs
=====
This is the early version of my emacs's configuration. Out of personal server's migration, I decide to put it here as a public repo so as to back it up.

I will keep updating it here until death or doom as it's not perfect yet and impossible to be perfect.

Emacs's a great IDE much more powerful than I could ever image. Emacs by definition is the old saying: 'Nothing's Impossible'. You can do whatever you want by emacs-lisp script to make self feel satisfied during coding.

Anyway, I love emacs...
